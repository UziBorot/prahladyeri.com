</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Today morning, I came across <a href="https://medium.com/@jacksoncunningham/digital-exile-how-i-got-banned-for-life-from-airbnb-615434c6eeba">this medium post</a> from Jackson Cunningham in which he describes how AirBnB simply banned him for life from their website without a due process. Jackson's mistake:<!--more--> He and his girlfriend rented an apartment with a rude host who came in barging in an hour before the checkout time and started forcing them out, and Jackson later wrote a review about it on Google (the AirBnB's own website didn't accept a negative review about a host as its their usual practice):</p>

<p>And Jackson isn't alone who has faced the wrath of this tech giant. As the top comments on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/8yk1rp/digital_exile_how_i_got_banned_for_life_from/">this reddit post</a> corroborate, many others who tried to rent through AirBnB have faced a similar consequence:</p>

<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/8yk1rp/digital_exile_how_i_got_banned_for_life_from/e2c5z36/</p>
<p>The broader philosophical question is how easy it has become for the large tech giants of the world to simply place a plebeian or commoner into a digital exile by one flip of a switch today. The problem isn't that a company like AirBnB is able to ban a user, the problem is that people have allowed AirBnB to become a kind of digital monopoly that is able to ruin one's earnings, employment and service availing for life by simply banning them. Its the people who have given them this power, or in other words, the plebeians have brought this upon themselves.</p>
<p>And as much as one would try to rationalize this as a natural result of capitalism, it isn't. This goes totally against the principle ofÂ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire"><strong><em>Laissez-faire</em></strong></a> (French for <em>let-go</em> or <em>free trade</em>) which forms the very basis of capitalism. So, even from the perspective of capitalism, banning a market agent without a due process in this way and putting them out of business goes totally against the spirit of free trade and capitalism. In fact, this is more resembling of and a digital equivalent of the Gladiator-era fascism where a Roman dictator can ban or exile any plebeian of the state at their whims.</p>
<p><img alt="Roman Dictator" class="size-full" height="429" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*lfFsZKCyj5HSvBY5" width="800"></p>
<p><strong>Roman Dictator (Image Source: Medium.com)</strong></p>
<p>And how did the Romans solved their dictator problem? That's right, they brought in democracy and civic structure, they decentralized their political system so that its divided into multiple ministries and provincial bodies now, so that <em>one dictator</em> shouldn't be able to affect everything at his whims.</p>
<p>The same thing needs to happen in the digital world today, I'd like to see a world where there are tons of alternatives to AirBnB, Amazon, Ebay, Microsoft, Uber, etc., a world where consumers don't give all the power to a few entities, and thus screw themselves in the process. The consumers should have many alternatives, so that if one service bans them, there are a ton of others, and in order for this to happen, the open source programmers also have a large role to play.</p>
<p>Even a consumer should not source everything from one service by succumbing to convenience, but cultivate a habit of giving new players a chance. Why use only Amazon for shopping, also try Ebay, Flipkart, Snapdeal, AliExpress, etc. once in a while. Why use only Uber for cabbing, also try Ola, Lyft, Hailo, Meru, etc. once in a while. Remember plebeians, you are yourself responsible for the digital world you create, and each one of us is partly responsible in some way or other for Jackson's situation.</p>
